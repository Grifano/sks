<!-- ## My process

### Built with ?

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- JavaScript
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Responsive images
- Responsive Website -->

<!-- ### What I learned

Using "picture" tag, browser know what image should to load depending on viewport width ðŸ˜€

```html

```

I decide to create a custom arrow for tab headers Instead to use a svg. But I was wondering is that very complicated? Off Course a easy way is to use svg as a background image

```css

```

And this part is not clearly Understand For me. Why in if condition don't use an equal operator? It supposes if activeTab is true then run a code, but why activeTab Should be "true"?

```js

``` -->

### Continued development

I'm focusing to improwing my programming skils with HTML&CSS and JavaScript.
